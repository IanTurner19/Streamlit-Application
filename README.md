To the original app.py, I added code that allows the user to select columns in the csv file they uploaded.

If the data type of the column is numeric, it shows a statistical summary table and displays a density plot, and if the data type is categorical, it displays the frequency of each category in the column and displays a barplot.

Here is a link to the application
